# Pre-built monaco editor with workers

Look at `index.html` and `index.esm.html` for usage example.

Purpose of this repo is to be able to use Monaco editor in my projects without advanced tools.
Monaco is such big editor that I want to load it separately, and if I include it as a dependency
I then need to use advanced tooling or complicate my builds. 

I admire ease of use of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and it is my favourite tool at the moment, but having monaco pre-built also makes it start faster.
